# Open Google Calendar in Chrome

This is a simple [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) workflow that either finds https://calendar.google.com in one of your tabs and focuses on it or opens a new tab to Google Calendar.

A simple "Open URL" workflow will leave you with a bunch of Google Calendar tabs open.

## Installation

1. Download `google-calendar.alfredworkflow`.
2. Open file. Alred should open and import workflow.
